# UploadFolders
My test WebApp MVC for degenerates of GeeksForLess, which don't respect other people's time and other people's work.


•	Create a web site that will allow you to display a hierarchical directory structure.

•	DB for saving a hierarchical system of directories (folders). Fill the database with data from the schemas below.

•	Web plugin for displaying the structure of directories from the database. On the web page of the skin directory, display the name and list of child directories (items in the list will be sent).

•	For robots and vicorists asp.net core.

•	Bonus 1: add the ability to import the directory structure from the operating system or from a file (Bonus 2), with further savings from the database and images from the web add-on.

•	Bonus 2 (if Bonus 1 is added): directory structure that already exists in the database, which is exported to a file, with the possibility of further import.
